# Comparator
This package provides a way to compare the call graphs and memory graphs produced by sea-dsa using the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. This package includes a prebuilt binary of
sea-dsa built on Ubuntu 18.04 built for LLVM 10 which is used as the default. You can optionally change this default binary by including the path of the new binary when initializing the comparator object.

A sample use case is shown in example.py
